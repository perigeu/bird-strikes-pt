# AI Bird-Strike Risk Forecasting  ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

A hybrid ML + DL pipeline that predicts the daily probability of a bird-strike event (and expected strike count) for every major Portuguese airport.

* **XGBoost classifier** â€“ 30-minute resolution, trained on 7 cyclic time features + strike count.
* **Seq2Seq RNN** â€“ encoderâ€“decoder LSTM (64 units each) that produces a event-driven forecast.
* **Risk analytics** â€“ per-airport bird-mass factor, probability aggregation, daily risk score and 30-minute breakdown.




## 1  Methods

### 1.1  XGBoost Machine Learning Model

| item | value |
|------|-------|
| **features** | sin/cos hour, sin/cos DOW, sin/cos month, hour\_norm, strike count |
| **target**   | binary â€“ was there any strike in this half-hour? |
| **grid**     | `max_depth` {3,5,7}, `learning_rate` {0.01,0.1}, `n_estimators` {100,200},<br>`subsample` {0.8,1.0}, `colsample_bytree` {0.8,1.0} |
| **CV**       | 3-fold, ROC-AUC |

Best parameters and fold metrics are logged per airport.


### 1.2  Seq2Seq RNN Forecasting Agent

| part | detail |
|------|--------|
| **encoder** | 48 Ã— 30 min window (24 h) â†’ LSTM(64) |
| **decoder** | LSTM(64) â†’ 120 hourly steps (5 days) |
| **heads**   | *count* (MSE) &nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢&nbsp;&nbsp; *prob* (binary-XE) |
| **inputs**  | past features + XGBoost proba (stacked channel) |
| **training**| early-stopping = 10, batch = 32, epochs â‰¤ 100 |
| **Heads**| 2, one for ML other for RNN |
| **Neurons**| 130 per head |
| **Number of Parameters**| Approximately 1 Million |




## 2  Risk Calculation

For each forecast interval:

risk = predicted_strike_count Ã— cumulative_probability Ã— mass_factor

predicted_strike_count: rounded number of strikes in interval

cumulative_probability: sum of halfâ€‘hour probabilities until interval end

mass_factor: average bird mass (kg), thresholded at 1.8â€¯kg

Risk Levels

Risk Score

Level

Physical Meaning

Risk <Â 2.0 - Low - Minimal impact into the aircraft safety

Risk 2.0Â â€“Â 5.0 - Medium - Elevated risk and safety â€” consider increased monitoring

Risk >Â 5.0 - High - Significant risk and safety â€” implement active mitigation




## 3  Usage

Precompute metrics & forecasts




## 4  Data

Source: EASA Birdâ€‘Strikes dataset
